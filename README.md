## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Developer Notes

- Positioning images is hard, especially if it's positioned all fancy with layers on top of layers.
- I haven't had much experience working with SVGs prior to this project, but it was mostly the same as using JPEG and PNG images. Maybe in other projects or personal projects I might try my hand on making my own SVGs from scratch?
- This project required the use of JavaScript for expanding and collapsing the accordion, but a bonus challenge is to *not* use JS at all. I decided to take on that challenge. I think I did pretty well, except for the collapse transition.
